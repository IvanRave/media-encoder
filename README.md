Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert digital media stored in Amazon S3 into the audio and video codecs and the containers required by consumer playback devices. For example, you can convert large, high-quality digital media files into formats that users can play back on mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.
